title: My first blog post!
---

2020 is the year I blog more. It's also the year I start blogging. The goal is to post data analysis daily. That's 365 posts. Once a day. For a year.

The idea of it scares me. I have a lot of ideas I don't act on because I worry they aren't polished enough. There's a lot of things I don't do because I worry I won't do them well. But the only way to get better is to try. The only way forward is through.

Happy new year. Next post comes tomorrow.
