      <description>Sometime in October last year, the NBA added matchup data to their stats page, prompting Seth Partnow to tweet out this plot. With some “quick and dirty” python code, Daryl Blackport of pbpstats.com recreated this plot.

&amp;mdash; Anchorage Man (@SethPartnow) October 25, 2019 So, here I am, recreating this plot once again in R, and sharing the code here. It’s like a weird game of telephone, but with NBA matchup plots.</description>

      <description>In this post, I’ve implemented an ELO system for all 30 teams in the NBA, similar to the one available at FiveThirtyEight.com.
First, the ELO rating system is a simple way of ranking a pool of players that face each other in a series of head-to-head matches. After each match, the winner’s rating increases and the loser’s rating decreases, both by the same amount.
The update formula follows this basic structure, \(R_{new} = R_{prev}+k(S-p)\) , where \(k\) is the update factor and \(S\) is the result of the match (1 if won, 0 if lost, 0.</description>

      <description>The following is an adapted version of a final project submitted for my classification course
Typically, an NBA team will attempt shots that maximizes their expected points per shot. For example, consider how a three-point shot with a 0.35 probability of scoring has a higher expected points per shot (\(E(S_{3ptr})= 3 \cdot 35\% = 1.05\)) than a two-point shot with a 0.45 probability of scoring (\(E(S_{2ptr})= 2 \cdot 45\% = 0.</description>
