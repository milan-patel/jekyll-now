      <description>In this post, I’ve implemented an ELO system for all 30 teams in the NBA, similar to the one available at FiveThirtyEight.com.
First, the ELO rating system is a simple way of ranking a pool of players that face each other in a series of head-to-head matches. After each match, the winner’s rating increases and the loser’s rating decreases, both by the same amount.
The update formula follows this basic structure, \(R_{new} = R_{prev}+k(S-p)\) , where \(k\) is the update factor and \(S\) is the result of the match (1 if won, 0 if lost, 0.</description>

      <description>The following is an adapted version of a final project submitted for my classification course
Typically, an NBA team will attempt shots that maximizes their expected points per shot. For example, consider how a three-point shot with a 0.35 probability of scoring has a higher expected points per shot (\(E(S_{3ptr})= 3 \cdot 35\% = 1.05\)) than a two-point shot with a 0.45 probability of scoring (\(E(S_{2ptr})= 2 \cdot 45\% = 0.</description>

      <description>2020 is the year I blog more. It&#39;s also the year I start blogging. The goal is to post data analysis week. That&#39;s 52 posts. Once a week. For a year.
The idea of it scares me. I have a lot of ideas I don&#39;t act on because I worry they aren&#39;t polished enough. There&#39;s a lot of things I don&#39;t do because I worry I won&#39;t do them well. But the only way to get better is to try.</description>
