      <description>In this post, I’ve implemented an ELO system for all 30 teams in the NBA, similar to the one available at FiveThirtyEight.com.
First, the ELO rating system is a simple way of ranking a pool of players that face each other in a series of head-to-head matches. After each match, the winner’s rating increases and the loser’s rating decreases, both by the same amount.
The update formula follows this basic structure, \(R_{new} = R_{prev}+k(S-p)\) , where \(k\) is the update factor and \(S\) is the result of the match (1 if won, 0 if lost, 0.</description>
